One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "choices": ["if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour", "how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour", "whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"], "caption": "A large white kite is in the air.", "orc": "[]", "Answer": "B", "metadata": {"has_image": true, "grade": 7, "subject": "natural science", "topic": "science-and-engineering-practices", "category": "Engineering practices", "skill": "Evaluate tests of engineering-design solutions"}, "pid": "15576"}, {"Question": "What is the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns?

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour", "choices": ["how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour", "whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour", "if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour"], "caption": "A large white kite is in the air.", "orc": "[]", "Answer": "A", "metadata": {"has_image": true, "grade": 8, "subject": "natural science", "topic": "science-and-engineering-practices", "category": "Engineering practices", "skill": "Evaluate tests of engineering-design solutions"}, "pid": "10244"}, {"Question": "Which tense does the sentence use?\nMom will pitch the ball to Preston.\nOptions: (A) present tense (B) future tense (C) past tense", "choices": ["present tense", "future tense", "past tense"], "caption": "no img", "orc": "no img", "Answer": "B", "metadata": {"has_image": false, "grade": 5, "subject": "language science", "topic": "verbs", "category": "Verb tense", "skill": "Is the sentence in the past, present, or future tense?"}, "pid": "9593"}, {"Question": "What is the mass of a cement truck?\nContext: Select the best estimate.\nOptions: (A) 24 pounds (B) 24 ounces (C) 24 tons", "choices": ["24 pounds", "24 ounces", "24 tons"], "caption": "no img", "orc": "no img", "Answer": "C", "metadata": {"has_image": false, "grade": 5, "subject": "natural science", "topic": "units-and-measurement", "category": "Units and measurement", "skill": "Choose customary units of mass"}, "pid": "20745"}, {"Question": "Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?\nNeptune's volume is more than 50 times as great as that of Earth.\nContext: Use the data to answer the question below.\nOptions: (A) true (B) false", "choices": ["true", "false"], "caption": "A computer generated image of a baseball game.", "orc": "[([[17, 7], [67, 7], [67, 25], [17, 25]], 'Planet', 0.8958227853410764), ([[86, 4], [256, 4], [256, 30], [86, 30]], 'Volume (billions of km ))', 0.6334107743987349), ([[269, 5], [420, 5], [420, 29], [269, 29]], 'Primary composition', 0.7976747356971964), ([[7, 37], [72, 37], [72, 62], [7, 62]], 'Mercury', 0.9999881049618138), ([[161, 39], [183, 39], [183, 57], [161, 57]], '60', 0.9999256537687161), ([[329, 43], [363, 43], [363, 59], [329, 59]], 'rock', 0.99996018409729), ([[17, 73], [65, 73], [65, 89], [17, 89]], 'Venus', 0.9999722777068452), ([[155, 71], [187, 71], [187, 89], [155, 89]], '930', 0.6935288906097412), ([[329, 75], [363, 75], [363, 89], [329, 89]], 'rock', 0.9999184608459473), ([[19, 101], [61, 101], [61, 121], [19, 121]], 'Earth', 0.8866540936963856), ([[149, 101], [193, 101], [193, 121], [149, 121]], '1,090', 0.9999466345049123), ([[329, 105], [363, 105], [363, 121], [329, 121]], 'rock', 0.99996018409729), ([[21, 135], [61, 135], [61, 151], [21, 151]], 'Mars', 0.99998939037323), ([[155, 133], [187, 133], [187, 151], [155, 151]], '160', 0.9999991052683532), ([[329, 135], [363, 135], [363, 151], [329, 151]], 'rock', 0.9975444656644031), ([[12, 162], [68, 162], [68, 186], [12, 186]], 'Jupiter', 0.9999960381929892), ([[133, 163], [209, 163], [209, 183], [133, 183]], '1,431,280', 0.7777767290740515), ([[331, 167], [359, 167], [359, 185], [331, 185]], 'gas', 0.9997106631417176), ([[15, 195], [65, 195], [65, 213], [15, 213]], 'Saturn', 0.7103452339118944), ([[141, 197], [203, 197], [203, 213], [141, 213]], '827,130', 0.999722797691145), ([[331, 199], [361, 199], [361, 215], [331, 215]], 'gas', 0.9999430815157786), ([[13, 227], [67, 227], [67, 245], [13, 245]], 'Uranus', 0.7503099794359693), ([[145, 225], [197, 225], [197, 245], [145, 245]], '68,330', 0.7514095714498152), ([[333, 227], [357, 227], [357, 245], [333, 245]], 'ice', 0.9998810016324764), ([[9, 259], [73, 259], [73, 277], [9, 277]], 'Neptune', 0.5541340203297859), ([[145, 255], [199, 255], [199, 275], [145, 275]], '62,530', 0.9932741650031028), ([[333, 259], [357, 259], [357, 275], [333, 275]], 'ice', 0.9992298134046173)]", "Answer": "A", "metadata": {"has_image": true, "grade": 6, "subject": "natural science", "topic": "earth-science", "category": "Astronomy", "skill": "Analyze data to compare properties of planets"}, "pid": "17488"}, {"Question": "What information supports the conclusion that Michelle inherited this trait?\nContext: Read the description of a trait.\nMichelle has wavy hair.\nOptions: (A) Michelle's parents were born with wavy hair.
